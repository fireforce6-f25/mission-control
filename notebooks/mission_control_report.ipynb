    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "California wildfires present an escalating threat requiring rapid, coordinated responses across multiple fire fronts with complex resource allocation decisions. Traditional firefighting approaches struggle to process the volume and velocity of information necessary for effective modern fire management.\n",
    "\n",
    "We present the Mission Control Dashboard, a web-based application built with React.js and Django that integrates real-time fire and drone telemetry with AI-driven tactical planning. The system provides operators with unified situational awareness through interactive map visualizations, intelligent alerting mechanisms, and a conversational interface to an AI Fire Warden agent that generates and presents tactical deployment plans for human approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemented prototype successfully demonstrates core capabilities including real-time data visualization, notification management, and AI interaction workflows. While currently operating with mock data, the system architecture is designed for seamless integration with production Fire Cloud and Fire Warden services, establishing a foundation for data-driven wildfire response operations.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent wildfires in California have resulted in devastating damages to communities, threatening lives, destroying property, and disrupting the livelihoods of countless individuals. The increasing frequency and intensity of these fire outbreaks demand a fundamental shift in how we approach wildfire management and response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively combating wildfires requires the ability to keep pace with their rapidly changing nature. Firefighting teams must account for the speed at which fires progress, understand how environmental factors such as weather patterns and terrain influence flame intensity across different regions, and make critical decisions about resource allocation - often balancing the preservation of key structures and residential areas among multiple simultaneous fire fronts. Traditional firefighting approaches, while heroic, are fundamentally limited in their capacity to process and respond to the volume and velocity of information required in modern fire scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current technological landscape offers unprecedented opportunities to transform firefighting into a more data-driven, intelligent operation. Advances in network technology now enable the transmission of critical data at speeds unimaginable a decade ago—including real-time streaming of telemetry from drones, satellites, and ground sensors. Simultaneously, the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) capable of ingesting vast amounts of data and reasoning about complex scenarios presents a new paradigm: expert fire analysts can focus on strategic planning while agentic AI systems autonomously execute routine deployments and monitoring tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These emerging technologies-embodied in our system as a high-speed Fire Cloud data infrastructure and an intelligent AI Fire Warden agent—create both opportunity and necessity for a sophisticated operator interface. In this paper, we present the **Mission Control Dashboard**, a web-based application built with React.js and Django (Python) that integrates these advanced capabilities into a unified command center. The dashboard provides operators and firefighters with real-time visualization of ongoing fires and deployed drones on an interactive map, delivers critical alerts about situational changes such as weather updates or new fire emergencies, and enables intuitive communication with the AI Fire Warden, including the ability to review and approve or deny autonomous action proposals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 surveys existing dashboard implementations in firefighting and emergency response, while also reviewing the software technologies and theoretical foundations underlying our system. Section 3 presents a comprehensive concept-of-operations, detailing system requirements, stakeholder needs, mission objectives, capabilities, system entities, data flows, behavioral states, and operational scenarios - all formally modeled using ontology-based systems engineering. Section 4 demonstrates the dashboard prototype through screenshots and a walkthrough of common user scenarios. Finally, Section 5 discusses the limitations of the current implementation and outlines directions for future enhancement.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 2. Background & Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Existing Fire Management Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A prominent example of fire management dashboard technology is the **Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS)** for US/Canada, a collaborative effort between NASA and the USDA Forest Service [1]. FIRMS provides satellite-based imagery of ongoing fires across North America, offering both historical archives and near-real-time data on fire locations and intensity. The system has proven valuable for large-scale fire monitoring and has been widely adopted by emergency management agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, FIRMS exhibits several limitations when considered in the context of modern firefighting needs. First, the system relies exclusively on satellite imagery as its data source, which differs fundamentally from the multi-modal sensor architecture envisioned in the Fire Force VI challenge that incorporates drone telemetry alongside satellite data. Drones offer higher spatial resolution, more frequent update cycles, and the ability to operate beneath cloud cover, which are advantages that satellite-only systems cannot provide. Second, FIRMS functions primarily as a visualization tool for fire locations and does not integrate critical operational features such as real-time alerting for significant situational changes or communication interfaces for coordination with autonomous agents. Third, as fire situations become more complex with multiple simultaneous fronts, FIRMS' interface can become cluttered and difficult to interpret under high-stress operational conditions (Figure 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Firms](./Images/FIRMS.png)\n",
    "Figure 1: A screenshot of the FIRMS Mission Control Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Mission Control Dashboard: Design Principles and Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our proposed Mission Control Dashboard addresses these limitations through three key innovations. First, the system integrates real-time drone telemetry alongside satellite data, providing operators with a more comprehensive and granular view of fire dynamics. Second, the dashboard consolidates all critical operational functions into a unified interface: the live map view, contextual notifications of significant events (weather changes, new fire detections, drone status updates), and direct communication channels with the AI Fire Warden. This approach reduces cognitive load during emergency operations by eliminating the need to switch between disparate systems. Third, the interface prioritizes clarity and usability, with a clean design optimized for rapid information comprehension under stressful conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Technology Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mission Control Dashboard leverages modern web technologies selected for their maturity, performance characteristics, and development velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Frontend Architecture**: The client interface is built with **React.js**, a component-based JavaScript library that enables rapid prototyping and benefits from an extensive ecosystem of supporting packages. We employ **TanStack Query** for sophisticated data management - this library provides automatic caching of network requests, background refetching, and centralized API state management, significantly improving application responsiveness and reducing server load. For geospatial visualization, we integrate **Leaflet.js**, an open-source mapping library that supports custom marker overlays and and interactive map controls essential for displaying fire perimeters and drone positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backend Architecture**: The server infrastructure is implemented using **Django**, a high-level Python web framework known for its rapid development capabilities. Django provides robust support for RESTful API endpoints through Django REST Framework, enabling synchronous data queries for historical information and system configuration. For real-time data streaming - critical for live fire updates and drone telemetry - we leverage **Django Channels**, which extends Django to support WebSocket protocols. This bidirectional communication channel allows the server to push updates to connected clients immediately as new data arrives from the Fire Cloud, ensuring operators always view the most current situational awareness picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technology stack balances development agility with production-grade performance, enabling iterative refinement of the user experience while maintaining the reliability and scalability required for emergency response systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. System Architecture and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents the conceptual architecture of the Mission Control Dashboard through six interconnected perspectives: stakeholder requirements, mission-capability mappings, entity definitions, operational activities, behavioral state machines, and operational scenarios. These views collectively form a comprehensive concept of operations that guides the system's design and implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. Stakeholders and Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The system's primary stakeholders consist of personnel involved in firefighting operations, including both on-the-field firefighters and command center operators. The system requirements are derived directly from stakeholder needs, encompassing real-time mapping capabilities, historical fire visualization, adaptive user experience, and related functionalities. The table below presents a comprehensive summary of these requirements."

    "## 4. Demonstration and Evaluation\n",
    "To illustrate the dashboard in real operation, we present a four-part demonstration sequence drawn from our scenario exercises: \n",
    "### Main Page\n",
    "The main page serves as the central operator hub, aggregating live mission status, recommended actions, and a persistent event log. It surfaces both ongoing scenario data and urgent notifications, offering field commanders a real-time situational snapshot. See Figure 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Main Page](./Images/Main_Dashboard.png)\n",
    "Figure 2: Main page dashboard interface showing active hazard zones, recent scenario logs, and summary status indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fire Warden Chat Interface\n",
    "A real-time chat module connects operators with the AI Fire Warden subsystem. Through this interactive interface, operators exchange deployment preferences, receive AI-generated recommendations, and log advisory exchanges for future review. The chat design balances clarity and immediacy while ensuring critical information is never lost. See Figure 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Fire Warden Chat Interface](./Images/Fire_Warden.png)\n",
    "Figure 3: Fire Warden chat interface allowing for interactive conversation between the operator and the AI planning engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Live Map\n",
    "The live map display visualizes current wildfire perimeters, hazard overlays and deployed assets as supplied by FireCloud analytics and AI Fire Warden planning. Map elements update in near real-time as new sensor, weather, or planning data arrives, demonstrating the dashboard’s efficacy in guiding tactical response. See Figure 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Live Map](./Images/Live_Map.png)\n",
    "Figure 4: Live map display illustrating wildfire boundaries and assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notifications\n",
    "The notification module synthesizes alerts from both Fire Warden and FireCloud, prioritizing actionable items such as newly detected hazards, changes in asset deployment, and time-critical operator instructions. Its layout and filtering functionality act to minimize operator overload. See Figure 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Notifications](./Images/Notifications.png)\n",
    "Figure 5: Notification panel displaying live hazard alerts, AI deployment advisories, and scenario-linked updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "Our system currently relies on mock data with respect to the Fire Cloud and Fire Warden interactions since these aforementioned systems are not completely developed. As a result, quantitative analysis regarding latency can not be explored currently. However, our system can be evaluated qualitatively. Namely, our system is able to properly execute its described capabilities by enabling real-time visualizations of fire and drone data (even if this data is purely mock data), ensuring key situational developments are made aware to users via notifications, and finally allowing fire an easy-to-use interface with the (mock) Fire Warden.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Conclusion and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Mission Control Dashboard project demonstrates how technical vision, collaborative engineering, and persistent operator feedback can converge in life-critical wildfire response scenarios. By integrating advanced sensor fusion, AI-driven planning, and human oversight into a seamless interface, we established both the technical and organizational tools for more agile, impactful disaster operations. The dashboard not only delivered on its foundational goals but also opened new avenues for cross-team coordination and continuous improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Development Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "The current implementation relies on mock data for prototyping purposes. The immediate priority for future work involves integration with production external systems, specifically the **Fire Cloud** data infrastructure for real-time fire and drone telemetry, and the **Fire Warden** AI service for tactical analysis and planning recommendations. These integrations will enable the dashboard to operate with live sensor data and autonomous decision-making capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond core system integration, several functional enhancements would significantly improve operational effectiveness. **Plan visualization on the map** would allow operators to preview AI-generated tactical plans spatially - for example, displaying proposed drone flight paths or deployment zones directly on the live map interface before approval. **Satellite tracking** capabilities could be added to visualize orbital assets alongside ground-based sensors, providing operators with complete awareness of all data collection resources. Finally, **direct drone command and control** through the map interface would enable operators to issue movement orders, recall commands, or mission reassignments by selecting drone markers and interacting with a control panel, streamlining the command workflow for time-critical scenarios.\n",
